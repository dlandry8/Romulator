These are the software code files used in the development of the ROM Emulator. They are divided into the following:
  * Romulator:  The code files for the PC interface.
  * Arduino:    The code files to be uploaded to the Arduino on the Emulator board.
  * Test files: Assembly programs to test with the ROM Emulator.
