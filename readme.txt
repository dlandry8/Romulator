Welcome to Romulator, the ROM Emulator created by team Romulator for the University of Washington, Bothell's STEM program.
This is a group capstone project: the culmination of computer and electrical engineering bachelor's programs. Team Romulator
consists of:

David Landry: project manager and chief software engineer.
Biniyam Yemane-Behane: chief technical engineer.
Thien Nguyen: chief logistical and materials engineer.
Nema Karimi: chief compliance and documentation officer.
Dr. Arnold S. Berger: Faculty & industry advisor and chief mentor to our group.

Romulator is a ROM Emulator. It is a device that emulates ROM on a target system under test. This device can be used to
write test programs or test existing programs for an embedded system without the need to burn a ROM chip.

With the prominence of flash memory, this technology is considered legacy. However, its design demonstrates an understanding
of memory addressing, project management, schematic design, and software programming for both hardware and software.

Romulator consists of:
   * The ROM Emulator board prototype, currently held by the University of Washington, Bothell's department of STEM. The board is not currently       
       functioning.
  * Romulator, the software interface for Microsoft Windows.
  * RomArd, the program written to the on-board Arduino Mega.
